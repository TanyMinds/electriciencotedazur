The main circuit breaker is a protective device that must be installed by the company that manages the electrical network (in France, this is often Enedis). It is located where the electrical cable from the public network enters the building (usually outside).

To install a main circuit breaker, the following steps must be followed:

1. Choose the location: the main circuit breaker should be placed where the electrical cable enters the building, preferably outside, to facilitate access in case of intervention.

2. Prepare for installation: before installing the circuit breaker, it is important to cut off the electrical supply to the building to avoid any risk of electrocution.

3. Install the circuit breaker: the circuit breaker must be securely fixed to a suitable support, such as a wall or pole, following the manufacturer's instructions. The electrical cable from the public network must be connected to the circuit breaker.

4. Verify operation: once the circuit breaker is installed, it is important to verify its proper operation by energizing it and performing tests to ensure that it cuts off the electrical supply in the event of overload or short circuit.

It is important to remember that the installation of a main circuit breaker must be carried out by a qualified professional to ensure the safety of the electrical installation.
