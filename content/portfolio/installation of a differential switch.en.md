The installation of a differential switch is an operation that must be carried out by a qualified electrician. Here are the general steps for installing a differential switch:

1. Cut off the electrical supply using the main circuit breaker.
2. Choose the location for the differential switch based on the requirements of the electrical panel and current standards.
3. Mount the differential switch on the DIN rail of the electrical panel and connect it to the connection terminals.
4. Connect the power wires and the load wires to the differential switch. The power wires must be connected to the input terminals of the differential circuit breaker, while the load wires must be connected to the output terminals.
5. Check the connections to ensure that they are properly tightened and secured.
6. Restore the electrical supply by re-engaging the main circuit breaker.
7. Test the differential switch to ensure that it is working correctly by pressing the test button.

It is important to follow the specific instructions of the differential switch that you are installing, as the instructions may vary slightly depending on the model and manufacturer. If in doubt, it is recommended to seek the help of a qualified electrician for installation.
