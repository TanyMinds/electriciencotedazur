This Christmas book is about an artificial Christmas tree turning 40, about Tammy and Bobby who understand that 40 Christmas trees have been saved over the years, about the Cradle in love with the Broken Pot and more. On top of all this is a story that will delight children waiting for Santa and wake up the child in all of us, with twinkling eyes and still dreaming.

A perfect book choice for seasonal read-alouds, Christmas reading and holiday gift-giving. Recommended age is 4-12 years, but who doesn't love a new Christmas story…
