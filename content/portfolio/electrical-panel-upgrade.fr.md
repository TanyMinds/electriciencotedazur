Upgrading the electrical panel is an operation that consists of bringing the electrical panel of your home into compliance with the electrical standards in force. This usually involves replacing the old electrical panel, which may be outdated and not meeting current safety standards, with a new electrical panel that meets current safety standards.

The electrical standards in force vary according to the countries and regions, but in general, bringing the electrical panel up to standard involves the following operations:

1. Installation of residual current circuit breakers: Residual current circuit breakers are safety devices that automatically cut off the power supply in the event of a short circuit or an electrical overload. They are mandatory in new electrical installations and must be installed in existing electrical panels when they are brought up to standard.

2. Replacement of fuses: Fuses are often replaced by circuit breakers. Fuses are less reliable and can be dangerous in the event of an electrical overload.

3. Installing the grounding: The grounding is a safety device that allows electrical current to be discharged safely to earth. It is mandatory for all electrical installations and must be installed when bringing the electrical panel up to standard.

4. Checking the electrical cables: The electrical cables must be checked and replaced if necessary when bringing the electrical panel up to standard. Cables that are damaged or do not meet safety standards must be replaced.

It is recommended to call on a professional electrician to bring your electrical panel up to standard. He will be able to check the electrical installation of your home and carry out the necessary work to bring your electrical panel into compliance with the standards in force.
