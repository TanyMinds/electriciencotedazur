The installation of wiring with copex consists of installing one or more electrical cables inside a protective copex. This method is often used to protect cables from physical damage and electromagnetic interference.

Here are the steps involved in installing wiring with copex:

1. Preparation: Before beginning, it is important to check that the copex is long enough to cover the entire distance between the two connection points. Also, make sure that the cables are the correct length and stripped at the ends.

2. Attachment: Attach the copex along the mounting surface using special fasteners or clamps. Make sure the copex is taut and does not form any loops or folds.

3. Cable routing: Once the copex is fixed, insert the cables inside. Make sure the cables are aligned correctly inside the copex and do not cross or touch each other.

4. Connection: Connect the cable ends to the connection points following the instructions of the electrical diagram.

5. Closure: Once the cables are connected, close the copex using clips or fasteners. Check that the copex is securely closed along its entire length.

6. Testing: Before energizing the installation, perform a continuity test to verify that all cables are correctly connected and that there are no short circuits.

It is important to note that the installation of wiring with copex should be performed by a qualified professional to ensure safety and compliance with current electrical standards.
