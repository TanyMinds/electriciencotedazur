Hello, I am Ghenadie. I come from the Republic of Moldova and I have been married for 17 years and I have 2 boys. Until 2016, I lived in Chișinău, Republic of Moldova, where I worked in an advertising agency. 

For the last 6 years, I have been living in Romania where I worked as a real estate agent. 

I speak fluent Romanian and Russian, and I have conversational French and English skills, which I am still studying. 

Apart from advertising, I have also worked in another field, electricity. I stumbled upon this field and I liked it from the start, and it has become more of a hobby for me. I have been working in this field, under the supervision of a licensed electrician, for over 12 years and I have carried out various jobs such as:

- Electric network at a gas station
- Electric network at an auto service center
- Electric network at a car wash
- Various repairs
- Houses, apartments, offices, etc.
- I also have experience in maintaining electrical networks in houses, apartments, and offices.

In 2022, I decided to make my hobby my main occupation, and the result was the Professional Skills Certificate, which I obtained in January 2023. I am now a self-employed electrician.

This certificate and the self-employed status give me the opportunity to do what I know and love here, on the French Riviera. 

If you are looking for an electrician who has knowledge, continuously develops his skills, and enjoys his work, I am the one. Together, we can find optimal solutions that meet French standards and satisfy your needs.
