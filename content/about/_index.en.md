description = """\"Fuzing parenting experience with studies in NLP, personal development, child psychology, marketing, business and law. Through the blog I want to highlight the importance of children's education adequate time in which we live. We cannot educate the children of the 21st century with the same tools with which we, the parents, were educated. Many of them require an UPGRADE, as children say. They see the world through completely different filters than we do. I want us to try together to distinguish from the multitude of information only the essential! I will try to explain the complexity of things by simplifying, until we get to the essence.\""""
